For hdf5_mass_at_snap for 100 iterations on katana at core = 1, ncpu = 10, ram = 8GB it takes 140 min to run on Katana.
But it only used 0..9 core as I did not add a multipool processing parallelisation.

Look at comments on improving time in "get_mass_at_snap". The below link has a "Job queue limits summary" overview table.
